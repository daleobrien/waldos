<b>History of Waldos</b>  </H6>
    
<div class="w3-row w3-padding">


    <p class="w3-left-align w3 padding-16">

The beginning of the group began when Sal Simson and Peter Phelan happened to be sitting in adjacent chairs in the chemo day ward when it was based at the SI Bone Marrow Unit at Christchurch Hospital in early 2009. <br>
A nurse approached and asked &#34;You have Waldenstr&#246;m&#39;s don&#39;t you&#63;&#34; Peter replied &#34;Yes&#34;, before he realised the nurse was talking to Sal.</p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3 padding-16">Peter had written &#40;via snail mail&#41; and received information from the IWMF in 1996 when it was almost a one man band with Arnold Smokler based in Florida.</p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3 padding-16">Sal and Peter talked of forming a NZ patient&#39;s group affiliated to the IWMF and Sal agreed to be the contact person which set things in motion.</p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3 padding-16">The IWMF Torch issue of July 2009 was the first to record Sal as the New Zealand Support Group contact. Unfortunately Sal&#39;s time in this role was brief, as sadly, she passed away four months later. Peter was on a project in Perth at the time, and received an email from Russell, Sal&#39;s husband, informing him of her passing. After a successful chemo regime Sal had developed a rare complication of WM where the central nervous system was affected &#40;Bing-Neel syndrome&#41;. Peter says &#39;In the brief period of our friendship it became apparent that Sal was a selfless person who willingly gave her time to help others. I think it is important that the record shows that she was the original founder of our support group&#39;.</p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3 padding-16">Michael Goldschmidt was asked by the IWMF to be the next co-ordinator. The magazine NZ Doctor 30&#47;06&#47;2010 on page 26 under General News, published a piece &#34;New Support group for WM sufferers.&#34; In the article which had information about WM, it also stated that &#34;Michael had contact with the nine New Zealanders who contacted the US foundation, but believes there are more people in New Zealand diagnosed with WM who are not aware of the foundation.&#34;</p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3 padding-16">The name Waldos came about when Peter and Michael were enjoying a coffee in Sumner and they thought the group should have a name. Peter thought up Waldos and so it became.</p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3 padding-16">Michael planned a meeting in Auckland in 2010 and a few people were able to attend.</p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3 padding-16">He and his wife Bronwyn enjoyed cycling together and Michael gardening, at their Redcliffs home and he was very involved in his local community in Christchurch. When Lea Hullett attended her first haematology appointment, Michael met her for lunch at the Boat Shed which was a popular venue being very near the hospital. He kept in touch and Lea called on him later and as his health was failing from another condition, Michael asked Lea to take over the group towards the end of 2017. The number of WMers was about 23 at that time.</p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3 padding">When the IWMF were making a list on their website of all affiliates worldwide we each had to have a logo. Not knowing the history about Waldos Lea made up a logo with WN&#45;NZ with a Kiwi.  </p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3 padding-16">Peter Phelan contacted Lea with the history of the group which Lea sent to the NZ list and no-one objected to the name Waldos being reinstated. </p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3 padding-16">So, our final logo is the result of suggestions from NZ Waldenströms patients, and an improved Kiwi having the lymphoma symbol included. </p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3 padding-16">The website a way to reach out to others who were looking for information and Lea set this up having been a designer since 1999. We needed a website about our New Zealand support group with links to correctly inform those seeking information about our quirky Waldenstr&#246;ms and also be simple enough not to overwhelm. Importantly,  information has to be factual and not just someone's opinion which might not have evidence based facts from a reliable source. <br></p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3 padding-16">At the end of 2024 Lea needed more time to care for her husband and asked for people to put their hands up if they were interested in the role of leadership for the Affiliate. Ken Baird and Steve Broderick were both keen and it was decided they could jointly become the new leaders of Waldos.
